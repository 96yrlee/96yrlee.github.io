## Here are some of the Projects I have done

Posts will get auto linked w/ a date I can make. However, I cannot make a blurb under each link.

I might convert to ```layout:page``` in order to do that and just link it manually. 
ex)

## [test project page](/_posts/2020-02-02-testPostProject.md)

This is a test page for projects.


OR I'll keep this and do the blurb, with additional links at the end. Might edit how categories work if that occurs.
