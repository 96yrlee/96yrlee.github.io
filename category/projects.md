## Here are some of the Projects I have done

Posts will get auto linked w/ a date I can make. However, I cannot make a blurb under each link.

I might convert to ```layout:page``` in order to do that and just link it manually. 
ex)

### [test project page](https://96yrlee.github.io/projects/2020/02/02/testPostProject.html) <sub> Jan. 01 - May 31 </sub>

This is a test page for projects. A short description of what it was and what *I did*


OR I'll keep this and do the blurb, with additional links at the end. Might edit how categories work if that occurs.
