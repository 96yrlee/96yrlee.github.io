## Personal Notes on How to Do This

### Side Bar
**Bottom Icons and their links**
Go to  ```_includes/custom-icon-links.html```

Copy code block 

Replace NAME with appropriate name for the link (ex. twitter)

Replace SITE_LINK with the start of the address (ex. https: //wwww.twitter.com/). 
    Rename NAME_NAME. This variable can be found in config.yml Note that {{<>}} can be removed and just have the whole link.

Replace ICON_MAGE_NAME with the name of the icon image file. Make sure the file is in the same folder. 
    If I get too many icons, I may make a new folder and need to readdress these to /svg/<>.svg
```
<a id="github-link"
    class="icon" title="NAME" aria-label="NAME"
    href="SITE_LINK/{{ site.NAME_NAME }}">
  {% include ICON_MAGE_NAME.svg %}
</a>
```
**Order of Navigation**
Got to ```_includes/sidebar-nav-links.html```

The last three lines determine if project pages or normal pages or icons go first.

The order of projects and pages themselves is determined by the ```sidebar_sort_order: <#>``` which is in the .md file itself. 
Basically, 1 goes first.

**Colour and Fonts and Others**
Go to ```assets/css/main.scss``` and name the variables. Check out the original repo for names of the variables and what they can do.

## Pages

**Categories vs Pages vs Posts**
Pages are just normal pages.

Categories group pages that are 'tagged' to belong within that category with 

Posts are pages that get sorted into categories.
  
  In order for posts to be collected, they MUST be:
  - named with YYYY-MM-DD-title.md format
  - tagged with this additional in the top
    ``` 
    categories:
    - NAME_OF-CATEGORY
     ```

## Welcome to GitHub Pages
