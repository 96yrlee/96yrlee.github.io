Let's have a place to show all the CAD i have done. maybe some FEAs if I have any.
Images and gifs (for animations)
Short blurbs explaining what, when, where, why. Link to project pages if applicable. 

For now just one page - if it gets too long, see if I can do an index thingy somehow.

God, I wish I asked if I could copy some models i made for Isowater. That shipping container and condensor would've rocked.
