## Hello again, my name is Yulim Lee. 

I am a Canadian living in the GTA. My family moved here from Seoul, S. Korea when I was a baby and I have grown up and lived here ever since.

As already mentioned on the main page, I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from U of T and I'm currently looking for a job.

Most of my details haev already been said, but to give a brief rehash:
* I have experience in process engineering, composite laminates, mechatronics and machine design. 
* Some of my most practiced skills are CAD design, stress analysis, troubleshooting devices and hands-on manufactoring. 
* I am also excellent at collaborating and organizing teams, learning new skills and knowledge for the job, adapting to set-backs and issues, and getting along with a wide range of personalities and backgrounds.

On a more personal note, I enjoy many art & crafts (which has surprisingly come very handy in manufactoring) such as knitting and sketching, read many books, and love to cook and bake. Often, I play video games with my friends and with my family's 5 dogs. I'm also polishing my Korean and continuing my German studies.
