## Hello again, my name is Yulim Lee. 

As already mentioned on the main page, I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from UofT and I'm currently looking for a job involving stress mechanics, mechatronics, product design and/or machine design.

As seen in my [CAD Portfolio](/CAD_Portfolio.md)~~, [Work Experience](/workExperience.md),~~ [Projects](/projects.md) and [Resume](/Resume.md), I've focused on creating 3D CAD models, stress analysis, and manufactoring prototypes. I also have a solid grounding in building, programming and testing circuits, with a solid grounding in both theoretical and practical.

On a more personal note, I enjoy many art&crafts (which has surprisingly come very handy in manufactoring) such as sewing, knot making, knitting and sketching. I also love to cook and bake. Often, I play video games with my friends and read many books. I'm also polishing my Korean and continuing my German studies.
