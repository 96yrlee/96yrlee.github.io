# Hi, I'm Yulim
I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate from Univeristy of Toronto. I minored in Robotics & Mechatronics, and also specialized in Solid Mechanics.

As a student, I have worked as a member of the fabrication team for both Blue Sky Solar Racing and FSAE.
I have also interned for a year with Isowater creating CAD models and building chemical process systems.

If you would like to see all the models and drawings I have made, checkout my [Portfolio](/CAD_Portfolio.md).

Otherwise you can look at the various [Projects](category/projects.md) I have done for more detailed descriptions of my past work.
