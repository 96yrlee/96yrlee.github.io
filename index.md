# Hi, I'm Yulim
I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from Univeristy of Toronto, where I specialized in Solid Mechanics and machine design and gained a minor in Robotics & Mechatronics. For the past year I have been furthering my education through various online courses such as Six Sigma, Java programming, statistic with SAS and others.

Interning for Isowater, I gained hands-on experience in the design, manufacturing and testing of process systems; For U of T's Blue Sky Solar Car team, I was a composite fabricator and machinist; And from various projects I have hands-on experience designing, calibrating and troubleshooting electronics, machines and code. As a result, I have skills ranging from CAD design and stress analysis to preparing technical documents and part/material selection.

**I am currently looking for a job!** My skills and experiences suit a role as a mechanical/process engineer, designer or technician, though I can also transition into quality, programming and consulting. I am alright with contract and part-time positions, and am also willing to relocate, travel for work, and to work both remotely and on-site (of course, only if it is legally permitted and the appropriate saftey measures are taken).

Checkout my [Portfolio](/CAD_Portfolio.md) to see the models and drawings I have made. 

Otherwise look over at my [Projects](category/projects.md) for more detailed descriptions of my past work.

## Website Progress
This website is undergoing improvements. You may notice some pages are too long, or some basic formatting/spelling errors.

### Website Theme Credit
This website jekyll theme is [Hydeout by Andrew Fong](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout). I've made a few minor changes to how categories work but otherwise its the same.

The markdown parser is kramdown. If I ever find one that has better tables, has image size editing, video linking, and collapsibles then I'll switch.
