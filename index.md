# Hi, I'm Yulim
I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from Univeristy of Toronto. I minored in Robotics & Mechatronics, and also specialized in Solid Mechanics. I am also currently looking for a job in those specialties!

I have interned for a year with Isowater, creating CAD models and building chemical process systems.

[comment]: # ( More details on what i was at iso?? )

As a U of T student, I have worked with:
- Blue Sky Solar Racing to fabricate the carbon fiber chassis and to machine structs.
- Formula SAE to machine various parts.

Checkout my [Portfolio](/CAD_Portfolio.md) to see the models and drawings I have made. 

~~Otherwise look over at my [Projects](category/projects.md) for more detailed descriptions of my past work.~~

Please contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yulim-lee-24b227131/).

### Website Progress
This website is currently still being set up, but the [Portfolio](/CAD_Portfolio.md) only needs final formating and edits! Projects, About, Work Experience and Resume are currently being worked on.
