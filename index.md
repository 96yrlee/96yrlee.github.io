# Hi, I'm Yulim
I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from Univeristy of Toronto. I minored in Robotics & Mechatronics, and also specialized in Solid Mechanics.

As a U of T student, I have worked with:
- Blue Sky Solar Racing to fabricate the carbon fiber chassis and to machine structs.
- Formula SAE to machine various parts.

I have also interned for a year with Isowater creating CAD models and building chemical process systems.

Checkout my [Portfolio](/CAD_Portfolio.md) to see the models and drawings I have made. 

Otherwise look over the various [Projects](category/projects.md) I have done for more detailed descriptions of my past work.
