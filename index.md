# Hi, I'm Yulim
I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from Univeristy of Toronto, and **I am currently looking for a job!**

**I am passionate about** developing sustainable, safe and innovative project and am eager to join a dynamic team and a company that understands the contribution its employees have on its success. 

**I am seekin a position** as a mechanical/process engineer, designer or technician, though I can also transition into quality, programming and consulting. I will accept contract and part-time positions, and am also willing to relocate, travel for work, and to work both remotely and on-site (though only if it is both legally permitted and if the appropriate saftey measures are taken).

**At U of T**, I specialized in Solid Mechanics and machine design and gained a minor in Robotics & Mechatronics. For the past year I have been furthering my education through various online courses such as Six Sigma, Java programming, statistic with SAS and others.

**As for skills and experience**, while interning for Isowater I gained hands-on experience in the design, manufacturing and testing of process systems; For U of T's Blue Sky Solar Car team, I was a composite fabricator and machinist; And from various projects I have hands-on experience designing, calibrating and troubleshooting electronics, machines and code. 

As a result, I have skills ranging from CAD design and stress analysis to preparing technical documents and part/material selection.

I am also capable of collaborating in multidisciplinary teams, working independently without supervision, delivering results on schedule in a demanding environment, adapting to set backs and new tasks, and getting along with a wide range of personalities and backgrounds.

## Website Progress
This website is undergoing improvements. You may notice some pages are too long, or some basic formatting/spelling errors.

### Website Theme Credit
This website jekyll theme is [Hydeout by Andrew Fong](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout). I've made a few minor changes to how categories work but otherwise its the same.

The markdown parser is kramdown. If I ever find one that has better tables, has image size editing, video linking, and collapsibles then I'll switch.
