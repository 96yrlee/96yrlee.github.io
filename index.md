# Hi, I'm Yulim
I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from Univeristy of Toronto. I minored in Robotics & Mechatronics, and also specialized in Solid Mechanics. I am also currently looking for a job in those specialties!

I have interned for a year with Isowater, creating CAD models and building chemical process systems.

[comment]: # ( More details on what i was at iso?? )

As a U of T student, I have worked with:
- Blue Sky Solar Racing to fabricate the carbon fiber chassis and to machine structs.
- Formula SAE to machine various parts.

Checkout my [Portfolio](/CAD_Portfolio.md) to see the models and drawings I have made. 

Otherwise look over at my [Projects](category/projects.md) for more detailed descriptions of my past work.

If you wish to contact me, please message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leeyulim/).

### Website Progress
This website is currently still being built, but [About Me](/about.md), [Resume](/Resume.md) and [Portfolio](/CAD_Portfolio.md) are complete! At most I'll update them and go through minor editing/formatting. 

[Projects](category/projects.md) needs to be proof-read and edited!  

Next is Work Experience.

#### Website Theme Credit
This website jekyll theme is [Hydeout by Andrew Fong](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout). I've made a few minor changes to how categories work but otherwise its the same.

The markdown parser is kramdown. If I ever find one that has better tables, has image size editing, video linking, and collapsibles then I'll switch.
