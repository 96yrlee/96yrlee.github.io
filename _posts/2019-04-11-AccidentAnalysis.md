# Outline

I collaborated with Ryan Chappus, Yunzhe Liu and Cissy Yao for UofT course APS440: MAking Sense of Accidents. The final project was to analysze a well-documented disaster using a systems-engineering approach; Specifically, to apply CAST.

Our group analysed the Lac-MÃ©gantic Train Derailment Disaster.

My responsibilities were to:
- define the hazards and constraints.
- define what an accident secifically meant
- create the Safety Control Strcuture with Cissy.

With my group, we all:
- defined the safety goal, system, and assumptions.
- researched the accident.
- write the report, create the presentation and present it to our class.
