## Introduction <a name="1"></a>

I collaborated with Ryan Chappus, Yunzhe Liu and Cissy Yao for UofT course APS440: Making Sense of Accidents. The final project was to analysze a well-documented disaster using a systems-engineering approach; Specifically, to apply CAST.

Our group analysed the Lac-Mégantic Train Derailment Disaster.

My responsibilities were to:
- define the hazards and constraints.
- define what an accident secifically meant
- create the Safety Control Strcuture with Cissy.

With my group, we all:
- defined the safety goal, system, and assumptions.
- researched the accident.
- write the report, create the presentation and present it to our class.

| ![img](/images/projects/lacMegantic/mma_railmap.PNG "MMA Railway System"){:width="500"} | **Safety Goal:** <br>To effectively and safely transport goods,<br> both dangerous and non-dangerous,<br> across North America via railway system.<br> <br> **System:**<br> The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway<br> and the surrounding community and regulatory environment. **Assumptions:** Ignores Orford Express, <br>a minor tourist line that<br> ran between Magog and Sherbrooke. <br>The system is the MMA railways that<br> only transports goods, not passengers.
