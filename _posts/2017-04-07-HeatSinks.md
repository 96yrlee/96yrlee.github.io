I worked with ---- for course MIE313: Heat and Mass.

The goal was to find the best locations to place the hint sinks to minimize the temerature of our circuit board.

I was responsible for deriving the equations and to create the code that simulated the circuit board.

We all performed test on the circuit board and heat sinks to gather data for the simulation, and tested out simulation results.
