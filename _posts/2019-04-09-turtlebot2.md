# Test images, links, text blorbs, etc here
This project was for the U of T course MIE443: Mechatronics Systems: Integration and Design. For the course, each group was assigned a Turtlebot2 to program control systems and complete three challenges:

1. [Mapping an enclosure](#1)
2. [Travel to and catalogue 5 objects before returning "home"](#2)
3. [Follow a user and react to the enviroment with emotions](#3)

I worked with Christine, Dave and Jack. Together, we all developed the strategies and control system architecture, wrote and tested the code on the turtlebot2, and wrote reports detailing our methodology and results.
