## Introduction 
This project was for the U of T course MIE443: Mechatronics Systems: Integration and Design. For the course, each group was assigned a Turtlebot2 to program control systems and complete three challenges:

1. [Mapping an enclosure](#1)
2. [Travel to and catalogue 5 objects before returning "home"](#2)
3. [Follow a user and react to the enviroment with emotions](#3)

I worked with Christine, Dave and Jack. Together, we all developed the strategies and control system architecture, wrote and tested the code on the turtlebot2, and wrote reports detailing our methodology and results.

## Turtlebot2 and Competition Basics

![img2](https://www.turtlebot.com/assets/images/turtlebot_2_lg.png){:width="225"} | A turtlebot is an open-sourced personal robot that runs on ROS. It comprises of a Kabuki base with motorized wheels and bumer sensor, a kinect sensor and some additional strcuture.

For each contest, we were restristed to using selected libraries. For example, in contest 1 we were not allowed to use the pre-package avoidance or mapping code, in contest 2 the path planning libraries and in contest 3 the user following libraries.

### Mapping an Enclosure: Object Avoidance and Autonomous Mapping <a name="1"></a>
In this contest, I was collobarated to tune the laser scan code and coding the exploration strategy. 

### Find and Catalogue Objects: Path Planning and Image Identification <a name="2"></a>
In this contest, I was responsible for creating the path planning functions, adjusting the given coordinates of the boxes and sorting all the data so my group could use it. I also collaborated on testing the robot for all purposes.

### Following a Person and Reacting: A Companionbot <a name="3"></a>
In this contest, I was responsible for creating a function that would recognizably emote as rage and ensuring the machine state triggered and transistioned out correctedly.  I also collaborated on testing the robot for all purposes.
