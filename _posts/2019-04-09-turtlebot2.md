# Test images, links, text blorbs, etc here
For U of T's course MIE443, we were each assigned a Turtlebot2 to program and test out code with.
I worked with Christine, Dave and Jack to program our Turtlebot2 to complete 3 challenges:
1. Map out an area
2. Travel to various boxes, scan the images on and idetenfiy which image each box posessed.
3. Follow a person and emote 4 different emotions.

Link to our Github repository with all of the code we used.

Explain each section, what I did specificaly and accomplished both individually and together.
