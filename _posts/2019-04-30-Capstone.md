#Outline

I worked with -----.

This was our capstone project for MIE490, where we worked for SolarShip Inc.

They asked for ----.

We created design concepts, choose one and refined it.

Gave several reports, presentations, including the final report and CAD models.

I did:
- a lot of the concept design
- created final CAD models and renders and animated
- collobarated on the report
