## Introduction and Basic Information <a name="1"></a>

I worked with Ahmad Nabi, Haoyu Huang and Yuming Zhang. This was our capstone project for MIE490, where we worked for SolarShip Inc. We created design concepts, choose one and refined it. Gave several reports, presentations, including the final report and CAD models.

I did:
- a lot of the concept design
- created final CAD models and renders and animated
- collobarated on the report

## Concept Design Phase <a name="2"></a>

Meetings with both the client and the supervisor to gain an understanding of what the client wanted and what we needed to do. I was the only one with experience using valves, so I explained to my team. I drew all of these designs as we brainstormed.
