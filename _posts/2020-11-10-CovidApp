## Introduction <a name="1"></a>
This was for the capstone project of the Coursera certificate and specialization **Android App Development ** which had 5 courses: 
Java for Android, Android App Components - Intents, Activities, and Broadcast Receivers, Android App Components - Services, Local IPC, and Content Providers, 
Engineering Maintainable Android Apps, and the Capstone project.

[Here's a link to my GitHub repo](https://github.com/96yrlee/Covid-19InfoApp)

To summarize, I created an Android app that shows the user the day's Covid-19 data, such as total cases, today's new cases, etc, for a country or the world. 
The user can search for a country to add to the main screen, remove a country, and click on a country's info card to get more specified information.
It uses an webservice api, [disease.sh](https://disease.sh/), which aggregates data from various sources such as Johns Hopkins University.

Loop analysis allows the output position, velocity and acceleration to be calculated and traced. The velocity of point G, and several acceleration formulas are needed to calculate the original force output of the mechanism for point G. 

The maximum values of R11 and  R12 is the position where the flogger hits the dead horse.

## Notes
A fair amount of the writing was summarized and all the diagrams were pulled from our reports, credit to my teammates.

This page to be incomplete, but sufficient. More details and edits to be added in time.
