## Introduction <a name="1"></a>

I worked on a team of four, with Adrian Cheung, Kyle McCarroll, and Nebojsa Jovanovic to build and program a motorized pendulum. 
The goal was to control the angle of the pendulum with using the rotor, motor controller, rotary encoder and Arduino. 
It had to return to the set angle when displaced near immediately.

My responsibilies were:
- to cut and set up the pendulum
- connect and solder the wires
- most of the tuning with Kyle, but Adrian and Nebojsa also spent many hours with us
Other fixed several issues with our wire connections,  took videos and pictures, and wrote most the report.
