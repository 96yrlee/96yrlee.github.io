## Introduction <a name="1"></a>
This was for the UofT course course MIE301: Kinematics and Dynamic of Machines. I worked in a team of 5 with Dahlia Milevsky, Julia Filiplic, Romaissa Allalou and Yiran Lu. 

The project Goal was to, essentially, redesign a mechanism to have more complex kinematics. It should take a product and ideally improve it. As a result, we had near complete freedom on what to do and remake - and thus, part of the project involved creating a client, their request and how we would address it professionally (i.e. reports). 

Our team decided to combine the nutcracker and an automaton toy, and make the movement to be more humanlike.

Loop analysis allows the output position, velocity and acceleration to be calculated and traced. The velocity of point G, and several acceleration formulas are needed to calculate the original force output of the mechanism for point G. 

The maximum values of R11 and  R12 is the position where the flogger hits the dead horse.

## Notes
A fair amount of the writing was summarized and all the diagrams were pulled from our reports, credit to my teammates.

This page to be incomplete, but sufficient. More details and edits to be added in time.
